# RouteClass

This `abstract` class, is the base for both HttpRoutes and SocketRoutes.

The structure of the routes folder determines the url required to access it.

```
+routes                   | not accessible by url
    /index.js             | http://example.com/
    +users                | not accessible by url
        /index.js         | http://example.com/users
        /create.js        | http://example.com/users/create
```

Property | Description
--- | ---
this.config | The config object passed to [Apigeon](https://github.com/vladfilipro/apigeon/blob/master/docs/apigeon.md) constructor
this.request | The [request object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) generated by the http server
this.connection | Instance of the [connection class](https://github.com/vladfilipro/apigeon/blob/master/docs/connection.md)
this.middlewares | An array of middlewares. These middlewares have to be set in the `setup( done )` method of the route and will be executed before the `hasAccess()` method. It's important to remember that the middlewares cannot send any data to the response object, because not all headers have been sent yet.
