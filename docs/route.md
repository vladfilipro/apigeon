# RouteClass

This `abstract` class, is the base for both HttpRoutes and SocketRoutes.

---

Property | Description
--- | ---
this.request | The [request object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) generated by the http server
this.middlewares | An array of middlewares. These middlewares have to be set in the `setup( done )` method of the route and will be executed before the `execute()` method. It's important to remember that the middlewares cannot send any data to the response object, because not all headers have been sent yet, unless the middleware stops execution by not calling the `done()` callback
